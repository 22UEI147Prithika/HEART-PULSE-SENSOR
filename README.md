A heart pulse sensor paired with an Arduino enables real-time monitoring of heart rate, creating a valuable tool for projects in health tracking, biofeedback, and wearable tech. This system functions by detecting blood flow through the fingertip or earlobe, where each pulse alters light absorption. By connecting a pulse sensor to an Arduino, the analog signal from the sensor can be captured, processed, and displayed as beats per minute (BPM), providing accurate heart rate data in a simple, accessible format.
Arduinoâ€™s versatility makes it easy to program and analyze the pulse data. Using an open-source pulse sensor library, we can measure raw signals and detect each heartbeat, allowing for visual outputs like LEDs, serial monitors, or even smartphone integration. This project introduces users to essential electronics and programming concepts, such as reading analog values, filtering noise, and setting detection thresholds.
Beyond technical skills, the project highlights the potential for low-cost, custom health devices, suitable for educational projects, DIY wearables, and health research. With minimal components and straightforward code, building a heart rate monitor becomes a hands-on learning experience, bridging the gap between technology and health monitoring in a fun, practical way.
